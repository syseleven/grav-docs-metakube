To download the kubeconfig, from clusters view select the correct cluster. On the top right you can find a button `Download config`:

The token in the kubeconfig gives you full admin rights within the Kubernetes cluster.
You can change the admin token by revoking the existing one on the cluster detail page. Already downloaded kubeconfigs are not valid anymore then and need to be re-downloaded:
